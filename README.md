# OpenWRT Build Files
Repository to host my builds of OpenWRT.

I'm using a TP-Link Archer C50 v4, and 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi on it with OpenWRT is awful. These are my builds with the patch as describe in [this forum post](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/archer-c50-v4-mac80211-looses-internet-access-after-20-away-from-router-but-maintains-connection/53575/55).
